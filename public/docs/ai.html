        <section id="opensource">
            <h2>Why Gemini Over Open Source Alternatives</h2>
            
            <p>While the AI landscape offers numerous open-source alternatives, Gemini 2.5 Pro stands apart through a combination of superior training, exceptional performance, and enterprise-grade security. Google's rigorous development protocols ensure a level of reliability that experimental models cannot match.</p>
            
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="comparisonChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            
            <p>Google's commitment to <span class="highlight">data security and authentication protocols</span> provides an additional layer of trust critical for planning applications that may involve sensitive information. This emphasis on security without compromising performance distinguishes Gemini from alternatives that excel in one dimension at the expense of others.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, Google's continuous model improvement cycle ensures that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently evolves with the latest research insights and performance optimizations—an advantage that fragmented open-source development often struggles to match.</p>
